        Hi, welcome to my coding portfolio! My name is Adam and I'm an Aussie
        (ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º), born 1989. I currently am living in Darwin, Australia. I have
        always been a well-rounded individual with a passion for learning. I
        started my career as an electrician, but since then I have discovered my
        passion for software development.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy staying active by swimming and riding my bike.
        I also love music and play the piano as a hobby. Additionally, I am an
        avid computer gamer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I consider myself a generalist, I love learning all kinds of topics,
        there is almost no subject that I am not at least a little bit
        interested in. I am especially interested in low-level programming and
        backend workflows and optimizations. I still have a lot to learn, but I
        am enjoying the journey and looking forward to seeing what the future
        holds in the field of software development.

    I am passionate about all things STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
    Mathematics).
  </p>
  <p>
    I am proficient in Python and enjoy its beautiful simple syntax. I have
    experience with the Django web framework and find it to be a powerful tool
    for building web applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I am expanding my skillset by learning TypeScript, Rust, and
    full-stack development. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a
    developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am also interested in collaborating on open-source projects. If you have
    an interesting project that you would like me to contribute to, please feel
    free to reach out. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope you find
    it informative and enjoyable.
