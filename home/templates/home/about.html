      Hi, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Adam and I'm an Aussie (ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º), born
      1989. I currently am living in Darwin, Australia. I have always been a
      well-rounded individual with a zeal for learning. I started my career as
      an electrician, but since then I have discovered my passion for software
      development.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy staying active by swimming and riding my bike. I
      also love music and play the piano as a hobby. Additionally, I am an avid
      computer gamer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I consider myself a generalist, I love learning all kinds of topics, there
      is almost no subject that I am not at least a little bit interested in. I
      am especially interested in low-level programming and backend workflows
      and optimizations. I still have a lot to learn, but I am enjoying the
      journey and looking forward to seeing what the future holds in the field
      of software development.

      I am passionate about all things STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
      and Mathematics).
    </p>
    <p>
      I am proficient in Python and enjoy its beautiful simple syntax. I have
      experience with the Django web framework and find it to be a powerful tool
      for building web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am expanding my skillset by learning TypeScript, Rust, and
      full-stack development. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a
      developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also interested in collaborating on open-source projects. If you have
      an interesting project that you would like me to contribute to, please
      feel free to reach out. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope
      you find it informative and enjoyable.
