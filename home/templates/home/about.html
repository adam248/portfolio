        Hi, My name is Adam and I am an Australian, born in 1989. I currently
        live in Darwin, Northern Territory. I have always been a well-rounded
        individual with a passion for learning. I started my career as an
        electrician, but since then I have discovered my passion for software
        development.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy staying active by swimming and riding my bike.
        I also love music and play the piano as a hobby. Additionally, I am an
        avid computer gamer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I consider myself a generalist, I love learning all kinds of topics,
        there is almost no subject that I am not at least a little bit
        interested in. I am especially interested in low-level programming and
        backend workflows and optimizations. I still have a lot to learn, but I
        am enjoying the journey and looking forward to seeing what the future
        holds in the field of software development.
