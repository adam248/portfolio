    Welcome to my coding portfolio! My name is Adam and I am passionate about
    all things STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).
  </p>
  <p>
    I am proficient in Python and enjoy its beautiful simple syntax. I have
    experience with the Django web framework and find it to be a powerful tool
    for building web applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I am expanding my skillset by learning TypeScript, Rust, and
    full-stack development. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a
    developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am also interested in collaborating on open-source projects. If you have
    an interesting project that you would like me to contribute to, please feel
    free to reach out. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope you find
    it informative and enjoyable.
