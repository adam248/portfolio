- [x] use bootstrap as I am a programmer first, designer second
- [ ] I need to create a checklist for when I need to update the pythonanywhere version
- [ ] add login page (social via github)
- [ ] create a Todo app can use it without login but with login it saves the data for a period of time.
- [ ] Visualize Sorting Algorithms
- [ ] Visualize Pathfinding Algorithms
- [ ] eCommerce Site
